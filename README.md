# Thieving Analysis App

## Introduction
This is an automation tool designed to streamline and track pick‑pocketing activity — specifically targeting **archaeology professors** and **Menaphite market guards**.  

If you’re tired of manually counting successful picks and bonuses, this tool automates the process and provides feedback on your thieving performance.

## Features
- Automatically works on **archaeology professors** and **Menaphite market guards**.  
- Auto-detects when you start thieving, so you don’t need to trigger the script manually.  
- Counts how many times you successfully pick‑pocket NPCs.  
- Tracks and logs additional bonuses (e.g., **camouflage bonus**, **agility bonus**) when they occur.  
- Performs data analysis to compute statistics about your thieving, helping you monitor performance over time.
